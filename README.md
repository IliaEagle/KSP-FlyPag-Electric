FlyPag Advanced Propulsion and Power Pack
This mod introduces a suite of powerful new components designed to enhance your spacecraftâ€™s performance through electric propulsion and high-capacity energy storage. Each part is ingeniously crafted from existing components for seamless integration with your tech tree.

Parts:

ENGINES:

1) **FlyPag_FL-450 Engine:**
A 0.625m propulsion system that offers a balance of power and weight. The FL-450 is designed to be two times less powerful and two times lighter than the FL-900, making it an excellent choice for smaller spacecraft. Its lightweight design allows for greater efficiency in space travel while still providing reliable thrust for a variety of missions.

2) **FlyPag_FL900 Engine:**
A 1.25m propulsion system that operates entirely on electricity, making it the perfect choice for eco-friendly spacecraft. The FlyPag_FL900 engine consumes 5 Electric Charges per second while delivering consistent thrust, effectively eliminating the need for traditional fuel sources. This innovative engine combines efficiency with sustainability, ensuring your missions are both powerful and environmentally conscious.

3) **FlyPag_FL6000 Engine:**
This powerful engine is engineered for demanding environments, specifically designed to facilitate landings and launches from EVE. With a staggering thrust of 2000, the FL6000 resembles a T30 engine but surpasses the Mainsail in strength. This remarkable engine provides the muscle needed to overcome the harsh conditions of EVE, ensuring a successful ascent and descent.

ELECTRONICS:

1) **FlyPag_FL-5k Battery:**
This high-capacity, 1.25m battery is designed to store an impressive 5000 Electric Charges, making it ideal for powering your energy-hungry engines and systems. Compact yet powerful, the FL-5k battery is rechargeable and ensures your spacecraft remains operational during extended missions, allowing you to explore the farthest reaches of the Kerbal system without the worry of running out of power.

2) **FlyPag_FL-1250 Battery:**
A compact, 0.625m version of the FL-5k battery, the FL-1250 provides a practical energy storage solution for smaller spacecraft. With a capacity suited for various missions, this battery ensures that even the most lightweight vessels can sustain their operations without sacrificing performance.

3) **FlyPag_FL-5xXL Solar Panel:**
A cutting-edge solar panel that generates five times more electricity than the standard XL version. Despite their similar appearance, the FL-5xXL excels in energy production, making it an essential component for powering your spacecraft sustainably during long missions.
 

Additionally, this mod features the SFL-900 Orbiter, an advanced spacecraft built using some of these innovative parts, and the SS2KSVE Jet, which showcases the versatility and power of FlyPag technology. Both vessels are designed to leverage the strengths of the new components, ensuring a remarkable experience in space exploration.
